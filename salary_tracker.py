**Introduction**

An app to track salary monthly and annually.
It can be developed to become a finance app to track incomes and spending/ saving.

**How to use?**

User can input hours of work, including evening, sunday, holiday, and tax rate in a period (a week,  a month.
User can also put the total amount working hours if they donâ€™t want the program to calculate.
As a result the income (after tax) is shown.

Basic goals:
- Read input file to get days, hours, bonus, etc
- Calculate total hours of work
- Calculate gross salary and after tax salary
- Store monthly and annually incomes

Later goals:
- Build a GUI with a calendar to take input about hours of working

Classes:
- WorkDay: date, hours of work, evening_hours, sunday_hours, salary
- WorkMonth
